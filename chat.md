13:56:15	 From Anna Kim : my bad for wasting time!

13:56:29	 From Hortencia : The naming @Annie kim

13:56:38	 From Kalkidan Taye : You didn’t waste time, now I see it clearer.

13:56:49	 From Waverley Leung : @Anna no that was a good question to establish what each relationship is!

13:57:08	 From Anna Kim : ^^ thanks y’all <3

14:16:24	 From Hortencia : backer

14:18:13	 From Dong Xia : heard that rubber ducky

14:18:51	 From Lida : lol

14:19:36	 From ChenYun Zhang : you didn’t invoke it

14:22:17	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : In ruby you capitalize only class names

14:22:34	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : And then constants are all caps

14:22:38	 From Anna Kim : ty ty

14:25:04	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : or add require_relative at the top on this file

14:25:12	 From Anna Kim : ^^^^^

14:25:17	 From Franklin Bado : require_all

14:25:54	 From ChenYun Zhang : we tried to do that too, require_relative, and got error, personally think run.rb is easier

14:25:58	 From Steven williams : I did the same thing….

14:26:07	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Yeah it’s a bit of a setup

14:26:12	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : to get it to work

14:27:10	 From ChenYun Zhang : yayyyyy, opened the cookie box

14:27:14	 From Nunny (she/her) : What was the question?

14:27:22	 From Dong Xia : line 17

14:27:33	 From Franklin Bado : Cookie magic

14:27:56	 From Dong Xia : kick the can open

14:28:19	 From Franklin Bado : So much violence, just open it code bender

14:29:22	 From Franklin Bado : Line 14

14:29:28	 From Dong Xia : look at attr

14:29:36	 From Anna Kim : @project

14:32:23	 From Anna Kim : def initialize is in the scope of a single instance
14:32:26	 From Nunny (she/her) : Good question steven

14:32:36	 From Anna Kim : so it would only return instance attrs

14:32:47	 From Anna Kim : if that helps @steven
14:35:29	 From Steven williams : Yes Anna, thanks.

14:37:26	 From Dong Xia : lol

14:37:44	 From Anna Kim : i wanna practice magic one day too

14:39:29	 From Anna Kim : 2?

14:39:38	 From Anna Kim : ooh

14:39:53	 From Franklin Bado : Lida ++

14:39:57	 From Kalkidan Taye : ^^

14:40:04	 From Anna Kim : i wonder why pj = _ didn’t work

14:40:06	 From Dong Xia : ⭕️

14:40:20	 From Anna Kim : maybe it had to be set outside of the class

14:40:20	 From Kalkidan Taye : Nice one Hortencia!!!

14:40:35	 From Anna Kim : hortencia +++

14:40:36	 From Nunny (she/her) : Hortencia++

14:40:46	 From Franklin Bado : Hehe Chenyun methodology

14:40:51	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : @Anna -> it did work! It made pj  assume the last 
value; there was no value in the prying session yet so that was nil

14:40:53	 From Franklin Bado : Children and parents

14:41:00	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Hortencia ++

14:41:12	 From Anna Kim : oh right :o nil is stil something

14:41:21	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Oh totally

14:41:31	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : “Nothing” in Ruby is “undefined”

14:41:34	 From Joshua Delapenha : As an older sibling I felt that

14:41:41	 From Anna Kim : ah because there was no @@all set to read the projectbacker?

14:41:42	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : nil is something

14:42:31	 From Joshua Delapenha : In the folder

14:56:57	 From Anna Kim : attr

14:58:06	 From ChenYun Zhang : backer should have attr_accessor :project

14:58:13	 From Anna Kim : yes

14:58:17	 From Anna Kim : i think so too?

14:58:33	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Nope, nope! You only add the instances to attr in the joiners

15:25:27	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Yeah this stuff always throws me off so much!

15:25:30	 From Franklin Bado : That’s some avatar stage Annie

15:25:39	 From Nunny (she/her) : 😯

15:25:48	 From Anna Kim : Sylwia you are just as calm!

15:25:51	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : she’s passed the rite of passage to be a Code Bender

15:26:12	 From Joshua Delapenha : Backer = self

15:26:21	 From Anna Kim : # \ 0 _ 0 / #

15:26:21	 From Joshua Delapenha : Backer == self?

15:26:51	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Womp womp

15:28:27	 From Nunny (she/her) : @everyone could Annie do inst_pb.self ?

15:28:30	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Steven ++

15:28:55	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : @Nunny -> you’re close

15:29:11	 From Anna Kim : .self wouldn’t work because it’s not a method?

15:29:17	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : inst_pb.backer gives us an instance of a backer

15:29:27	 From Anna Kim : instt_pb.backer == self ?

15:29:29	 From Nunny (she/her) : inst_pb.backer.self ?

15:29:33	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Aaaand we call backed_projects on another instance of a backer

15:29:43	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : So we could compare these two!

15:30:30	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : self is a variable and not a method, Nunny :)

15:30:44	 From Nunny (she/her) : ooooh ^^^^

15:31:01	 From Nunny (she/her) : I can call methods on self but not the other way around

15:31:06	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : YES

15:31:07	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : YES

15:31:19	 From Nunny (she/her) : 🕺

15:31:25	 From Kalkidan Taye : ^^

15:31:46	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : @Steven, I like to think about this as when I go to a wedding and there are cards with names on the tables -> and I go from one name to the next and look for my name until I find it

15:32:02	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : But instead of just name there’s another me sitting there :D

15:32:38	 From Nunny (she/her) : Daisy ++

15:33:12	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : oooor you go to the Christmas tree and see 10,000 gifts and from that huge pile choose only the ones that have your name on the ticket by checking one by one
